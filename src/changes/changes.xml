		<release version="1.3" date="2009-01-01"
			description="First Release with name 1jar-maven-plugin">
			<action dev="SchubertT006" type="update">
				Because no contact to the
				author of onejar-maven-plugin (Drew Stovall) via mail
				(onejar-maven-plugin@dstovall.org) was established, so i have
				renamed the project to 1jar-maven-plugin.
				This was done to avoid
				trouble with identical version of my code with the code of the
				original author (Drew Stovall).
				I would like to merge the different
				versions for the future. The author
				could contact me via mail to
				development@thomas-michel.info.
